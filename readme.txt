To run (Requires Unreal Engine version 4.14):

Either:
	1) Run the Unreal Editor, version 4.14. Then open MyProject.uproject
Or:
	2) Set up your machine to automatically open .uproject files with the 4.14 editor (for me it was found at C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\4.14\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe)
	Then simply open MyProject.uproject from the file explorer

The project will open in the Unreal Editor. From there you can test the game, or view the various blueprints and such we have created.

From here you many also either build the project to run it out of test mode without making an executable, or Package the project to create an executable that you can run any given number of times to play the game.
